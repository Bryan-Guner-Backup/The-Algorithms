<h1 id="projecteuler">ProjectEuler</h1>
<p>Problems are taken from https://projecteuler.net/.</p>
<p>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Project Euler is ideal for mathematicians who are learning to code.</p>
<p>Here the efficiency of your code is also checked. I’ve tried to provide all the best possible solutions.</p>
<p>PROBLEMS:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3,5,6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below N.</p></li>
<li>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,.. By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed n, find the sum of the even-valued terms.<br />
e.g. for n=10, we have {2,8}, sum is 10.</li>
<li><p>The prime factors of 13195 are 5,7,13 and 29. What is the largest prime factor of a given number N? e.g. for 10, largest prime factor = 5. For 17, largest prime factor = 17.</p></li>
<li>A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers which is less than N.</li>
<li>2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder. What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible(divisible with no remainder) by all of the numbers from 1 to N?</li>
<li>The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is, 1^2 + 2^2 + … + 10^2 = 385 The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is, (1 + 2 + … + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640. Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers and the square of the sum.</li>
<li><p>By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13. What is the Nth prime number?</p></li>
