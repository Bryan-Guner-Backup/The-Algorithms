      Guidelines for reviewers and maintainers
    </h1>
    <p>
      Following are some guidelines for contributors who are providing reviews
      to the pull-requests.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        On any given pull-request, there only one reviewer should be active at a
        time. Once the reviewer is done, others may add short comments or any
        further reviews as needed. Again, one at a time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assigning reviewers should be avoided unless the pull-request is for a
        particular task the reviewer is more proficient in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Any contributor who has had their code merged into the repo can provide
        with reviews as they have gone through the repo standards at least once
        before. The reviewer will be on a first-come-first serve basis.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most repositories have a check-list in the description for
        pull-requests. Many times, the contributors are not following them and
        simply remove the checklist or checkthem without taking the time to
        review the checklist items. These contributors are almost always copying
        the code from somewhere. These should be pointed out politely and
        reviews should be blocked until the contributor updates the basic code
        structure per the checklist and the repo standards.
      </li>
      <li>
        The reviewers should label every pull-request appropriately - including
        “invalid” as the case may be.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some pull-requests have existing duplicate code or duplicate
        pull-requests or sometimes, a novice might create a new pull-request for
        every new commit. This is a daunting task but one of the responsibility
        of a reviewer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Discourage creating branches on the repo but rather fork the repo to the
        respective userspace and contribute from that fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some repos - C &amp; C++ - have collaboration with GitPod wherein the
        code and the contribution can be executed and tested online with
        relative simplicity. It also contains tools necessary to perform debug
        and CI checks without installing any tools. Encourage contributors to
        utilize the feature. Reviewers can test the contributed algorithms
        online without worrying about forks and branches.
      </li>
      <li>
        There should not be any hurry to merge pull-requests. Since the repos
        are educational, better to get the contributions right even if it takes
        a bit longer to review. Encourage patience and develop debugging skills
        of contributors.
      </li>
    </ol>
