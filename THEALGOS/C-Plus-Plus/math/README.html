<h1 id="section">Prime factorization</h1>
<p>Prime Factorization is a very important and useful technique to factorize any number into its prime factors. It has various applications in the field of number theory.</p>
<p>The method of prime factorization involves two function calls. First: Calculating all the prime number up till a certain range using the standard Sieve of Eratosthenes.</p>
<p>Second: Using the prime numbers to reduce the the given number and thus find all its prime factors.</p>
<p>The complexity of the solution involves approx. O(n logn) in calculating sieve of eratosthenes O(log n) in calculating the prime factors of the number. So in total approx. O(n logn).</p>
<p><strong>Requirements: For compile you need the compiler flag for C++ 11</strong></p>
