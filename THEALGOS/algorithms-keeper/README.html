      A bot for
      <a href="https://www.github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python"
        >TheAlgorithms/Python</a

      repository. This bot is based on
      <a href="https://github-app-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"
        >this tutorial</a
      >
      and also inspired by the ones working for the
      <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">CPython</a> repository which
      are <a href="https://github.com/python/miss-islington">miss-islington</a>,

      <a href="https://github.com/python/the-knights-who-say-ni"
        >the-knights-who-say-ni</a

      repository using

    <ul>
      <li>
        To indicate that some tests are failing for this pull request if it is
        not present and remove it when all the tests are passing. It does
        nothing if the tests are already passing.

      </li>
      <li>
        To indicate the stage the pull request is currently at. This is a cycle
        of two labels which indicates the two stages: The pull request requires
        a review/re-review, or a maintainer has requested changes for the pull
        request.
      </li>
      <li>
        To indicate whether the pull request contains merge conflicts or not.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The pull request stages can be best described in a
      <a href="http://www.webgraphviz.com/">graphviz</a> diagram whose code is

    <h3 id="close-invalid-pull-requests">Close invalid pull requests</h3>
    <p>A pull request is considered invalid if:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It doesnâ€™t contain any description.</li>
      <li>
        The user has not ticked any of the checkboxes in the provided pull
        request template.
      </li>
      <li>
        The file extension is invalid. For now only PRs with extensionless files
        are closed.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Close additional pull requests by user

    <p>
      A user will be allowed a fix number of pull requests at a time which will
      be indicated by the <code>MAX_PR_BY_USER</code> constant. This is done to
      avoid spam pull requests. This can be disabled by updating the constant
      value to 0: <code>MAX_PR_BY_USER = 0</code>.

      Check all Python files in a pull request

    <p>
      All the Python files will be checked for tests
      [<code>doctest</code>/<code>unittest</code>/<code>pytest</code>], type
      hints and descriptive class/function/parameter names. Labels will be added
      and/or removed according to the latest commit in a pull request. The bot
      will post the review with all the details regarding the missing
      requirements.

    <p>Some actions of the bot can be triggered using commands:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>@algorithms-keeper review</code> to trigger the checks for only
        added pull request files.
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>@algorithms-keeper review-all</code> to trigger the checks for all
        the pull request files, including the modified files. As we cannot post
        review comments on lines not part of the diff, this command only modify
        the labels accordingly.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="logging">Logging</h2>
    <p>
      Logging is done using the standard library logging module. All the API
      calls made by the bot are being logged at INFO level and
      <code>aiohttp.log.access_logger</code> is logging the POST requests made
      by GitHub for delivering the payload. Other minor events relevant to the
      repository is also being logged along with using the using
      <a href="https://sentry.io/">Sentry</a>. The logs can be viewed best using
      the following command (<a
        href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install"
        ><em>requires Heroku CLI</em></a
