      Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming
      problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve.
      Project Euler is ideal for mathematicians who are learning to code.

    <p>
      Welcome to
      <a href="https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Ruby">TheAlgorithms/Ruby</a>!
      Before reading the solution guidelines, make sure you read the whole
      <a
        href="https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Ruby/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"
        >Contributing Guidelines</a
      >
      as it wonâ€™t be repeated in here. If you have any doubt on the guidelines,
      please feel free to
      <a href="https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Ruby/issues/new"
        >state it clearly in an issue</a
      >
      or ask the community in
      <a href="https://gitter.im/TheAlgorithms">Gitter</a>. Be sure to read the

      before starting solution.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Please maintain consistency in project directory and solution file
          names. Keep the following points in mind:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create a new directory only for the problems which do not exist yet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please name the project <strong>directory</strong> as
            <code>problem_&lt;problem_number&gt;</code> where
            <code>problem_number</code> should be filled with 0s so as to occupy
            3 digits. Example: <code>problem_001</code>,
            <code>problem_002</code>, <code>problem_067</code>,
            <code>problem_145</code>, and so on.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        You can have as many helper functions as you want but there should be
        one main function called <code>solution</code> which should satisfy the
        conditions as stated below:
        <ul>
          <li>
            It should contain positional argument(s) whose default value is the
            question input. Example: Please take a look at
            <a href="https://projecteuler.net/problem=1">Problem 1</a> where the
            question is to
            <em>Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.</em> In
            this case the main solution function will be
            <code>solution(limit = 1000)</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the <code>solution</code> function is called without any
            arguments like so: <code>solution()</code>, it should return the
            answer to the problem.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
