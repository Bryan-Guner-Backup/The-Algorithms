      In cryptography, a <strong>Caesar cipher</strong>, also known as Caesar’s
      cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar’s code or Caesar shift, is one of the
      simplest and most widely known encryption techniques.<br />
      It is <strong>a type of substitution cipher</strong> in which each letter
      in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions
      down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be
      replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. <br />
      The method is named after <strong>Julius Caesar</strong>, who used it in
      his private correspondence.<br />
      The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated as
      part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigenère cipher, and still has
      modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet
      substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern
      practice offers essentially no communication security.

    <h3 id="vigenère"><a href="./vigenere.rs">Vigenère</a></h3>
    <p>
      The <strong>Vigenère cipher</strong> is a method of encrypting alphabetic
      text by using a series of <strong>interwoven Caesar ciphers</strong> based
      on the letters of a keyword. It is
      <strong>a form of polyalphabetic substitution</strong>.<br />
      The Vigenère cipher has been reinvented many times. The method was
      originally described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his 1553 book La cifra
      del. Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso; however, the scheme was later
      misattributed to Blaise de Vigenère in the 19th century, and is now widely
      known as the “Vigenère cipher”.<br />
      Though the cipher is easy to understand and implement, for three centuries
      it resisted all attempts to break it; this earned it the description
      <strong>le chiffre indéchiffrable</strong>(French for ‘the indecipherable
      cipher’). Many people have tried to implement encryption schemes that are
      essentially Vigenère ciphers. Friedrich Kasiski was the first to publish a
      general method of deciphering a Vigenère cipher in 1863.

      Transposition <em>(Not implemented yet)</em>
    </h3>
    <p>
      In cryptography, a <strong>transposition cipher</strong> is a method of
      encryption by which the positions held by units of plaintext (which are
      commonly characters or groups of characters) are shifted according to a
      regular system, so that the ciphertext constitutes a permutation of the
      plaintext. That is, the order of the units is changed (the plaintext is
      reordered).<br />
      Mathematically a bijective function is used on the characters’ positions
      to encrypt and an inverse function to decrypt.
